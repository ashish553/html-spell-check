  <div class="articleContainer__content"> <div class="paragraph"><p>Do misspelled words drive you into a red pen-wielding fury? Do you appreciate a well-placed semi-colon? You might be an English teacher. If not an English teacher, then you're definitely a lapsed English major. If you rejoice at <a href="https://www.southernliving.com/culture/yall-or-ya-ll">correct grammar</a>—including the proper uses of "affect" and "effect" and <a href="https://www.southernliving.com/culture/plural-last-name">how to make your last name plural</a>—you might also be part of that ever-proofreading group. Whether you're an English teacher, an English teacher-at-heart (there are plenty of us out there too), or someone who likes to point out typos wherever they may be, we have a challenge for you.</p></div> <div id="div-gpt-mob-square-flex-1" data-tier="1" class="ad ad-container ad-wrapper type-300x250 mobile-ad instream-ad karma-ad" role="complementary" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></div> <div id="div-gpt-square-fixed-1" data-tier="1" class="ad ad-container ad-wrapper type-300x250 tablet-ad instream-ad sister-ad karma-ad" role="complementary" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></div> <div id="div-gpt-square-fixed-2" data-tier="2" class="ad ad-container ad-wrapper type-300x250 tablet-ad instream-ad sister-ad karma-ad" role="complementary" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></div> <div class="paragraph"><p>If <a href="https://www.southernliving.com/christmas/correct-grammar-holiday-card">grammatical mistakes</a> make you cringe, take a look at the letter below, and test your <a href="https://www.southernliving.com/culture/fixing-vs-fixin">knowledge</a> of the English language.

"You're" – The contraction "you're" means "you are." The word "your" should be used with a noun to indicate possession, as in "your letter."<br>2. "Its" – "Its" is a word indicating possession, as in "its wheels." "It's" is a contraction meaning "it is." This sentence should read "It's always a pleasure…"<br>3. "Recieve" – You'll need to use the "I before E except after C" rule to find the correct spelling of "receive" here.<br>4. "Here" – "Here" indicates location. The writer should have used the homonym "hear," which indicates listening.<br>5. The third sentence is a run-on sentence – A period or a comma and conjunction would make a big difference in the readability of the phrase.<br>6. Subject-verb agreement – The subject of the sentence is "parts" (which is plural) and the verb is "was" (which is singular). The sentence should read, "The best parts of the vacation were…"<br>7. "To" – "To" is a preposition, as in "to the beach." Here, the writer should use "too," meaning also.<br>8. "Their" – "Their" is possessive. "They're" means "they are." In this case, the writer should use the third homonym, "there."<br>9. "Less" – "Less" should be used with an amount that you can't count, as in "less money" or "less animosity." The word "fewer" should be used with amounts that you can count, as in "fewer things," "fewer items," or "fewer stores."<br>10. Subject-verb agreement – "Is" is a singular verb. In this sentence, the verb should be plural, as in: "There are plenty of fun things to do…"<br>11. "I've running" – This verb should be "I am running" or "I have run." With contractions, "I'm running" or "I've run."<br>12. Incorrect word usage – The writer should have used the word "accepted" instead of "excepted."<br>13. Incorrect semi-colon usage – A semi-colon should be used between two related complete sentences, i.e. two connected independent clauses.</p></div> <div class="div-sm-inContent"></div> <h2>The Corrected Letter </h2> <div class="paragraph"><p>Dear Jane,</p></div> <div class="paragraph"><p>I was delighted to read your letter last week.
